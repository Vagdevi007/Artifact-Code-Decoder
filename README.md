# The Secret Code of Ancient Artifacts

## Problem Description

You are an experienced archaeologist who has discovered a collection of ancient artifacts containing a secret code. The artifacts consist of intricately carved stones, each engraved with a unique symbol. By arranging these symbols in a specific order, you can decipher the code and reveal its hidden message.

Your task is to write a program that takes a sequence of symbols as input and deciphers the code based on a predefined symbol mapping. Each symbol corresponds to a specific numerical value, and the code is deciphered by converting each symbol to its corresponding numerical value and combining them in order.

## Symbol Mapping

The symbol mapping is a dictionary that associates each symbol with a numerical value. The numerical values range from 1 to 26, representing the letters of the English alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on). You can hardcode the symbol mapping within your program or retrieve it from an external source (e.g., a file or database).

Example symbol mapping:

```python
{"@": 1, "#": 2, "$": 3, "!": 4, "%": 5}
```

## Input and Output

Your program should accept a sequence of symbols as input and output the deciphered code. The code is obtained by converting each symbol to its corresponding numerical value and combining them in order.

Example:

```
Input: "@#$!%"
Symbol Mapping: {"@": 1, "#": 2, "$": 3, "!": 4, "%": 5}
Output: "12345"
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the code deciphering logic based on the symbol mapping provided.
2. Design your program to handle different symbol sequences and mappings.
3. You may use any programming language of your choice.
4. Provide clear instructions on how to run and test your program.
5. Consider adding additional features or error handling as desired.
6. Document any assumptions or considerations made during the implementation.

## Happy Coding!

Feel free to unleash your coding skills to unlock the secrets hidden within the ancient artifacts! Good luck, and may you uncover the hidden message that has been lost for centuries.
